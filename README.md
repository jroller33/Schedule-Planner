# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.
These events are stored in the browser's Local Storage and persist on the page even after refresh or opening a new browser window. This app features bootstrap, moment.js, and dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.
